# Roadmap

This roadmap describes the plans and features for the development of dnscrypt-proxy-ios-mac through alpha, beta and release.

Primarily, this project started as a response to a "Help Wanted" request and as such is initially (in alpha) focused on a GUI client for another executable program - DNSCrypt-proxy!


## Alpha

Write a GUI client for iOS and Mac that interfaces (adapter) with the dnscrypt-proxy executable.
Actions in the GUI effect actions using the dnscrypt-proxy executable.


## Beta

A transitional phase, beta is setting up a firebase beta test and monitoring the app/functionality/user experience prior to first public release.


## Release (v1.x.y)

First public release! Make app available after completing all previous testing, validation and development steps.

Final step - respond to @frankDenis on GitHub Help Wanter posting. Ask for feedback/criticism!


## Release (v2.x.y)

AdapterClient-to-FullFledgedApp.
Implement the [DNSCrypt v2 Protocol](https://dnscrypt.info/protocol) in Dart (Flutter)!

This will provide a superior app experience while also creating potential for other client implementations or experiements or features.


## Open Questions/Issues

* Who/How to get review or audit of DNSCrypt protocol implementation? (needs to be as clear and accurate as possible)
* Beta releases testers? Firebase but, can I also find/pay for testers? Ask people?
* Monitoring + Observability in Beta - how best to monitor and validate app actions, settings and DNS configurations outside of development environment and on beta apps? Metrics/tooling/splunk'ing ?
* Why is Frank Denis so cool??!
